The NFC crypto wallet functions by first allowing a user to create or import a wallet, generating a secure keypair that gets stored on a physical NFC card as well as within the app. When the wallet is initialized, the card is formatted with vital data—such as the wallet address, coin objects, current balance, and transaction history—in a structured JSON or CBOR blob. Users can then receive funds by sharing this wallet address, and the card is updated after any incoming transactions.

For sending payments, the user taps the NFC card to bring up its data on the mobile device, where the available balance and coin details are displayed. The user then enters or selects a recipient address, and the app constructs an offline transaction. This transaction is signed offline with the private key stored on the card and stored locally until connectivity is restored. Once online, the app performs a verification through a dry-run against the Sui blockchain, and if all conditions such as coin locks and TTL are met, the transaction is submitted, updating both the blockchain and the local records. Security features, including one-time-use coin objects and TTL enforcement, are used to prevent double spending and ensure transaction validity.

For devices that do not have native NFC support, a fallback mechanism is available where transactions can be initiated and transmitted via generated QR codes instead. These QR codes serve as an alternative means to transfer the same secure wallet data and signed transactions, ensuring that offline transactions can still be processed even without NFC hardware. In both scenarios, external triggers update the local SQLite database and any persistent backend records, ensuring the wallet data remains synchronized with the blockchain and across devices.

In summary, the NFC crypto wallet uses a combination of physical NFC cards and mobile app functionality to securely store and manage wallet data, offline transaction signing, and real-time synchronization with the blockchain. With an optional QR code fallback, the system guarantees that even devices lacking NFC hardware can perform secure offline transactions, providing a seamless, versatile payment solution.
